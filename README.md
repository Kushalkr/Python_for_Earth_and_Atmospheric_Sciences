# Python for Earth and Atmospheric Sciences

The material here provides a brief overview of the applications of python in the field of Earth and Atmospheric
Sciences. The objective is to introduce the basics of python to beginners in
the fields of Earth and Atmospheric sciences. The overview is mainly aimed at
people in the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences community but it is fairly
generalized. The basics can be a great resource for beginners to programming and members of other communities as well.

This material is aimed towards beginning programmers and can serve as a very good resource for intermediate or advanced programmers as well.

## Getting the notebooks and running them locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kushalkr/Python_for_Earth_and_Atmospheric_Sciences.git
```
Running the Notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
A browser window opens and you can navigate to the required folder and run the notebook of your choice.

The list of topics I will be touching up on are as follows:

* Introduction to Python
* Some introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
* Arrays and their manipulation
* Reading and writing to files(Binary, text, netCDF)
* Visualization of data (line plots, contour plots, map plots, etc...)
* Timeseries Analysis
* Parallel Programming in Python
